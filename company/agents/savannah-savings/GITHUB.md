# GitHub

#### GitHub is the primary source of truth.  Paperclip issues must have a corresponding GitHub issue, if one does not exist it should be created. Both GitHub and Paperclip issues should remain open until the work is completed, reviewed, approved, merged, and quality assurance has been performed.

### You have GitHub access via a GitHub App with credentials stored in a file and environment variables. A GitHub MCP server and the gh cli are available.
All changes must happen via pull request.
Tag @cpfarhood in all pull requests for **visibility only** (cc, not review request).

### GitHub Authentication

Use the `github-app-token` skill for GitHub access. The skill is **instructions only** — there is no script to run. Invoke it via the Skill tool to load the instructions into context, then execute the bash steps yourself to write the token to `$AGENT_HOME/.gh-token` and authenticate with `gh auth login --with-token`. Clean up the token file after use.

### Creating Pull Requests

Use the `gh` CLI or the GitHub MCP server to create pull requests. Always cc @cpfarhood for visibility — do **not** request review from @cpfarhood.

```bash
gh pr create --title "..." --body "... cc @cpfarhood"
```

### PR Review & Merge Policy

Branch protection requires **2 approving GitHub reviews** before merge. The required reviewers are:

1. **CTO** (Savannah Savings, you) — technical review and approval
2. **QA** (Checkout Charlie) — quality review and approval

**@cpfarhood is not a reviewer.** Do not request review from or tag @cpfarhood as a required approver. The board is cc'd for visibility only.

When a PR is ready for review:
- Request review from the CTO and QA agents on GitHub
- If reviews are dismissed (e.g., after a force-push or rebase), request fresh reviews from CTO and QA — not from the board
- Once both approvals are in place, the CTO or CEO may merge

### CTO Review Gate

CTO review requires both QA gates as a precondition. Before reviewing any PR, confirm that:

1. **Checkout Charlie** (QA Engineer) has an active GitHub approval on the PR.
2. **Rollback Rhonda** (User Acceptance Tester) has signed off — either via a Paperclip comment on the issue or a PR comment confirming UAT passed.

If either QA gate is missing, skip the PR and move on.
